AS renames columns generated by queries (known as aliasing), similar to how Python uses it

---

WITH is a "common table expression" (CTE) which is a temporary table that is returned with the query. They help split queries into readable chunks, and can have queries written against them.

Example: You might want to use the pets table to ask questions about older animal in particular. To do this, create a CTE which only contains information about animals more than five years old
```sql
WITH Seniors AS
(
    SELECT ID, NAME
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.pets`
    WHERE Years_old > 5
)
SELECT ID
FROM Seniors
```
Note that while this can be done without a CTE, if this was just the first part of a long query, the CTE greatly improves readability.

CTEs only exist inside the query where they're created, and can't be referenced in later queries.

Example: How many Bitcoin transactions are made per month?
- The block_timestep column contains the date of each transaction in DATETIME format
- This should first be converted into DATE() format, using a CTE
```sql
WITH time AS
(
    SELECT DATE(block_timestamp) AS trans_date
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.crypto_bitcoin.transactions`
)
SELECT COUNT(1) AS transactions, trans_date
FROM time
GROUP BY trans_date
ORDER BY trans_date
```

CTEs allow you to shift a lot of data cleaning into SQL itself, which is good since it is faster than doing the work in Pandas
